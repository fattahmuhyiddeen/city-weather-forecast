### Highlights of the project

1. The app is not using any navigation library since there is no necessary need for that.
1. Even though the app is simple, but it it still use redux because I need to use `redux-persist` to persist and load data simpler.
1. For searching and listing the results, the app is using `react-native-complete-flatlist` library which is also actively maintained by myself until now (7 closed issues, 9 forks, 33 stars, 36 used)
